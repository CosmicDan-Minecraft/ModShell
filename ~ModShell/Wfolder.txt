Wfolder - Batch Tool Ver. 1.61 (c) 2003-2009, Horst Schaeffer
-------------------------------------------------------------

Wfolder opens a window with a directory tree, and makes the user's 
selection available in the batch process. 

The program can be used to set an environmental variable or to change
the current directory. 

Wfolder appends the name of the selected directory (with full path) to 
a user defined command string (like SET or CD), and sends this string 
to STDOUT. 
The output must be redirected to a temporary batch file, which is CALLed
to execute the command. Alternatively, you can use a FOR /F construct as
described in "GetOutput.txt".

By default the directory path will be returned in quote marks. 
Use option /noquote, if you want the result without quote marks 
(to append a file name, for example).

The /backslash option makes sure that the path is supplied with a
trailing backslash, so you can append a file name, no matter if the path
is G:\ or C:\somewhere.

To test the output at the command prompt just omit the redirection. 

+++ General syntax (in square brackets: optional): 

    Wfolder "Command" "initialDir" ["WindowTitle"] [/noquote][/backslash]

    Command: see below
    initialDir: full or relative path, enclosed in quote marks if necessary.
    For the current directory use a dot or ""; root of all drives: "\\".


+++ Example to set a variable:

    Wfolder "SET Folder=" "C:" "Select Folder" > temp.bat 
    call temp.bat

    This may produce a command like this in temp.bat:
    (Folder is a variable name of your choice)

    SET Folder="C:\selected\dir"


+++ Example to change directory [and drive]:

    Wfolder CD "%USERPROFILE%" "Select your folder" > temp.bat 
    call temp.bat

    This may produce a command like this in temp.bat:

    CD "C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Desktop"

    If the selected drive is not the current drive, an extra line will
    be generated to change the drive.


Notes:

    Command arguments must be separated by space (no commas). 
    
    If you specify any command other than CD or SET, this command will 
    be used in the output. In case the command ends with an equal sign,
    the space between command and selected directory will be omitted.
    Try out some commands without redirection to see the results.
    
    Remember to delete temporary batch files after use. A temporary file
    in the %temp% directory is recommended.
    
    The file fcd.bat is included to change directory at the command prompt.


Exit Code:

    Errorlevel 0: ok (selection by user)
               1: cancelled
             255: syntax error

Wfolder2.exe

    This program does the same as Wfolder.exe, however it uses the 
    standard Windows box
    
    Advantages: regional "ok/cancel"; "New Folder" option (W2K, XP) 
                Special Windows Desktop "folders"
    Disadvantages: Wfolder2 maybe a little slow on old machines 
    
    Note: The Wfolder2 window is centered on screen, whereas Wfolder is
    centered in the console window
